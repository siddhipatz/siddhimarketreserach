Extrusion is a widely used aluminum forming process that delivers almost unlimited possibilities in product design. The extrusion process is similar to the childhood pastime of creating long strands of play-dough by forcing the product through a plastic-shaped die. Fortunately, aluminums weight, strength and high thermal conductivity vastly outweigh that of play-dough, leading to its presence in a wide range of consumer and industrial goods. The aluminum extrusion process has the added benefit of enabling fast product development cycles due to its low-cost and flexible tooling. Manufacturers can accelerate prototype and testing phases by rapidly creating and evaluating different designs. This report focus on Aluminium Extrusion Machines marekt.

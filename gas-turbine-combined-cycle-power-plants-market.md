Gas Turbine Combined Cycle Power Plants Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029

The gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC) power plant market size is projected to reach USD 140.6 billion by 2030, from USD 94.8 billion in 2022, at a CAGR of 4.5% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

Combined Cycle Gas Turbines Effectively Challenge The Working And Efficiency Of Conventional, Simply Designed Cycle Plants By Producing Approximately 50.0% More Power From The Same Fuel Used. In Order To Achieve This Result, Combined Cycle Gas Turbines Utilize A Steam And A Gas Turbine In Unison. Moreover, The Waste Heat Produced Out From The Gas Turbine Is Directed Toward The Steam Turbine Close By, Which Creates Additional Power
